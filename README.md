build an e-learning platform with your own content management system (CMS). Online learning platforms are a great example of applications where you need to provide tools to generate content with flexibility in mind. In this chapter, you will learn how to build the functionality for instructors to create courses and manage the contents of courses in a versatile and efficient manner.
In this chapter, you will learn how to:
• Create fixtures for your models
• Use model inheritance
• Create custom model fields
• Use class-based views and mixins
• Build formsets
• Manage groups and permissions
• Create a CMS



In this chapter, you learned how to use fixtures to provide initial data for models. By using model inheritance, you created a versatile system to manage different types
of content for the course modules. You implemented a custom model field to order objects. You also discovered how to use class-based views and mixins. You worked with groups and permissions to restrict access to your views. Finally, you used formsets to manage course modules, and you built a drag-and-drop functionality with jQuery UI to reorder modules and their contents.
